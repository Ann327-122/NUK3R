v5.2

Added a *TINY* bit of safety because I got a little bit scared when bugtestign. this command:
NUKE dir C:\Program Files\TESTFOLDERFORNUK3RDELETE\

It worked luckily.


I added stuff to make sure paths with spaces work correctly,

I also made a thing that tries to give itself permission over a file if it's initially denied permission.
