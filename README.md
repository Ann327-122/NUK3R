HI!

Okay, so, 'NUK3R' (Nuker) is a 4AM Power-trip and curiosity induced nightmaresoftware,

It has Zero stops, safety protocols, or confirmation dialogs, so be CAREFUL.

and I hate Microsofts BloatBrowser so I've added a bunch of commands to irradicate it-
as best as I can using C.. I'm not very good at C, I'm best at Java and stuff.
But I didn't want to use python, ... and I'm not sure if you can create a CMD window with java...



CREDITS:

ICON: ME
CODE: ME

HEADACHES: ME & THE CODE & cl.exe

Just so you can actually see it's NOT a virus or malware, *Which I understand if you think it is lol.. There is no safety stuff what-so-ever.
I've included my terrible source code, (Nuk3r.c) and the commands for compiling, (Nuk3r.rc + compcmd.txt)
